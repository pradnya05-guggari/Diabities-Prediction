# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a person is diabetic or not using machine learning techniques. It uses a dataset containing medical parameters such as glucose level, BMI, insulin, age, and blood pressure. The model helps in early detection and supports healthcare decision-making.

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Model training using ML algorithms  
- Accuracy evaluation  
- User prediction (optional)

## 📂 Technologies Used
- Python  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
